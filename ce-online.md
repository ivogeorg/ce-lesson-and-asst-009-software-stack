# Lesson & assignments after 008

## Hardware branch
1. Need more serious serial support, in particular I2C. This will lead to micro:bit peripherals.
   1. Sensors & actuators.
   2. External memory.
   3. WiFi.
2. Lookup tables after multiplexors. This leads to FPGAs.
3. As a continuation of logic gates and computational components, FPGA (say, [TinyFPGA](https://tinyfpga.com/)) programming after 008 (logic gates) and 009 (computation).
4. FPGAs lead to designing computers (probably just 8-bit ones with TinyFPGA).
5. This may lead to Verilog-programmable FPGA (probably higher-end), then transition to denser fabric designs for VLSI.
6. RISC-V.
6. Novel processor design (ML, AI, etc).
   1. Architectures at [ScaledML 2020](http://scaledml.org/2020/)

## Software branch
1. micro:bit software stack.
2. mbed programming in C/C++ (bypassing the micro:bit DAL/runtime)
3. RTOS (mbed 5)
4. Better I2C support.

## Full-stack computer integration
1. Embedded systems.
2. IoT.
3. micro:bit extension packages.
4. Domain-specific hardware.

# MSU Denver CPE

- [Curriculum](https://www.msudenver.edu/cpe/curriculum/)
- [Program](https://www.msudenver.edu/cpe/program/)
- [Catalog entry](https://catalog.msudenver.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=26&poid=6946#)

1. Problematic CE topics:
   - comms (a & d comms, advanced comms)
   - power
     - actually missing from CPE, more like [EET](https://www.msudenver.edu/eet/; no EE at MSUD!)
   - VLSI
2. CE topics with no labs:
   - signals & systems
   - solid state device fundamentals (solid state electronics uses discrete elements and the lab is on uses)
   - a & d comms
   - control systems
   - computer networks
   - system reliability
   - security
   - multimedia
3. Missing from curriculum:
   - OS
